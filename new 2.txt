Dammit guys, please tell me i'm the douche in this setting
I know i don't matter in this community since i don't play much, or i do play but i don't have a noteworthy rank,
and i don't do stuff on settings much ...
but when yall said the VG settings will be reset this patch , I was like allright. Same old Same old.
I went in and selected my prefered resolution. I go 720p because my processor is cheap. Anyway, I know it's low which is sad, But I strait up don't operate on rank which is so low 
expecting this to be the end of vg settings tonight. I guess not. 
A couple of stone block allright, i'll check this later.

I have previously worked at an A&W location for a year. During said time, I have worked as both a cashier and a cook. I have been tasked to do everything, including cleaning the kitchen, preparing ingredients, cleaning the dining area and restocking supplies. I am confident I can provide adequate help after my employment.
